05. Navigating screen: H, L, M, ctrl+e, ctrl+y
---------------

Great progress! Your navigational skills are getting as good as a GPS system! :-) 

Let's look navigating through your screen. 

Can I jump to the top of my screen instantly?
How about to the bottom?
...Or the middle?

Yes! Yes, we can! 

To navigate to the top of the screen
H - to the top of the screen
    4H moves 4 lines below the top
L - to the bottom of the screen
    3L moves 3 lines above the last line
M - to midscreen

Let's just extend 
this file length
so you can have
more 
space.

Now how about scrolling along the screen?

Use:
ctrl+e - move the screen one line up
ctrl+y - move the screen one line down 

Don't forget the review questions on the bottom!




Review Questions:
1) Navigate through the following uppercase letters:
    Hello my name is Bobby.
  I don't know how to use white space properly.
     So sometimes I use four spaces, sometimes two,
         It really just depends on my mood.
2) Navigate from the beginning to the end of each sentence above.




Answers:
1) Use "-" and the [return] key
