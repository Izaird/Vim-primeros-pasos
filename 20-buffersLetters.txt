20. Buffers (letters): a-z, A-Z, " (quotation mark)
---------------
Alright, so to be completely honest, this number business is making my head hurt too.

If we want to pre-define slots for buffers, we can use lowercase letters (a-z) instead.
This way we have 26 buffer spaces, and retrieving is much more tractable.

Each letter of the alphabet indicates a slot in your buffer.

We can yank lines into buffers:
"eyy - yanks current line to buffer e
"a7yy - yanks the next seven lines to buffer a

Now we have two buffers ready to paste!
"eP - to paste before cursor
"ap - to paste after cursor

You can do similarly with deletion:
"fdd - cuts current line, and places into buffer f

Now here's where Vim gets exciting!

To append to a slot in the buffer, use a capital letter.
Let's say you had some words in slot q that you wanted to append to.

Simply use capital Q:
"Qyy - appends current line to buffer q

Now try pasting it to see how it appended to a buffer slot!
"q
