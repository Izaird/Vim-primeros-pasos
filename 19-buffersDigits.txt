19. Buffers (digits): 1-9, " (quotation mark)
----------------
As you have seen with cutting/deleting/yanking, when we delete some text it gets saved in the buffer.

To paste the buffer we used the p/P commands - but this is only for the most current deletion.

In fact, the last nine deletions from d or x commands are placed in your buffer. 

To recover a deletion, we use the following command:
"np - where n is the buffer number, from 1-9.

Try deleting the following lines, then reversing them out.

1. First
2. Second
3. Third
4. Fourth
5. Fifth

What if we don't know which number corresponds to the buffer?
We can traverse our buffer with a fancy trick:
"1pu.u.u.u 

1. First
Remember that the "." key is used to repeat commands.
The "u" key is used to undo a command.
With this combination, we are able to traverse across the list until we find the buffer we're looking for.
