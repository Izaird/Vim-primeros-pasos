16. Marking: m, 'x, `x, '', ``
---------------
Sometimes it can be helpful to bookmark a specific place within your file.
Vim allows you to set marks within a file with lowercase letters (a-z).

mark a here
mark b here

We can mark a location with any given character:
mx - marks x to a specific location. 
'x - moves to the bol of the marked x character.
`x - moves to the x character.
'' - Returns to the bol of the previous position.
`` - Returns to the exact position of the previous position.

mark x here
mark y here

You can also navigate between lowercase marks:
]' - jump to the bol with a lowercase mark
[' - jump to previous bol with a lowercase mark
]` - jump to exact position of the next lowercase mark
[` - jump to exact position of previous lowercase mark

You can also set global marks with uppercase letters (A-Z).
Try opening your .vimrc file, which sets the configuration of Vim, and press "mV".
This will mark that file and position with V.
Now press "'V" to open!

To list all marks,
:marks

To delete a line containing a mark,
:delmarks a - delete mark a
:delmark a-d - delete marks a,b,c,d
:delmarks abxy - delete marks a,b,x,y
:delmarks aA - delete marks a,A
:delmarks! - delete all lowercase marks (a-z)
