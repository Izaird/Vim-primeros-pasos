02. Navigating words: web, WEB
---------------

We can navigate through words in a line:
w - navigate to the beginning of the next word
W - same as w, beginning of the next WORD - ignoring punctuations

What's the difference between a word and WORD?

My sister's boyfriend's mother.

// Now with some simple java code
for (int i = 0; i < 10; i++) {
    System.out.println("I love vim's navigation tools.");
}

e - navigate to the last letter of the next word
E - same as e, ignoring punctuations

# now navigate through a simply Python function
def square(x):
    return x ** 2

b - navigate back to the beginning of a word
B - same as b, ignoring punctuations
