There are many ways we can delete text in a file.
x - delete the character at the cursor
     3x deletes current character + 2 characters to the right of cursor 
X - delete character to the left 
     3x deletes 3 characters to the left of cursor

We can also delete words or WORDs at a time.
d - delete something
    dW deletes to beginning of next WORD
    dE deletes to end of next WORD 
    dB deletes to beginning of previous WORD 

Let's try deleting all the words here.

Another nifty tool: 
. - repeat any command

Review Problems:

2) How do you activate REPLACE mode?





Solutions:
1) WORDs ignore punctuations. www.youtube.com has 5 words and 1 WORD.
2) "R"
