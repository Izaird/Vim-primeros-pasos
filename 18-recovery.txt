18. Recovery: 
---------------
If your system fails, your vim session will be closed abruptly.
You may think all your changes made after the last save are lost...

However, you can use the option -r to recover the edited buffer at the time of a system crash.

To get a list of all files that have been saved to the buffer:
$ vim -r

To recover a specific file, simply place the file name as an argument:
$ vim -r crashtest.txt
