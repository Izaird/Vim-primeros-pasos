07. Inserting and appending: i, a, I, A
---------------

Remember how Vim is known as a modal editor? 
This means that its state depends on what "mode" it's in. 
When vim starts up, it's in command mode.
Command mode is how you navigate, like we are now! 

Now let's say we want to insert some text. 
We can change into insert mode using several keys:
i - before the cursor
a - after the cursor
I - at the beginning of the line (first non-white space)
A - at the end of the line

Now we can start inserting things!

Let's say this is some cool text block,
and you want to insert an adjective before "text".

*** Remember to hit the ESC key to return to COMMAND mode! ***

// Find the two error in this java code
x = 0;
if (x = 0)
  System.out.println("I love Vim.")

# Or python if you want
L = ["vim", "is", "so", "!"]
for n in L
  rint(n)

BTW or LOLCODE...
HAI 1.2
  CAN HAS STDIO?
  VISIBLE "CAN I LUVS VIM!!!1!"
KTHXBYE




Solutions:
Java: Make the "=" in the parenthesis to make "==" and insert a semicolon at the end using "A;"
Python: add a ":" at the end of the for statement, and a "p" in front of "rint"
LOLCODE: nothing's wrong with this one -- just wanted to use it as a fun example!
