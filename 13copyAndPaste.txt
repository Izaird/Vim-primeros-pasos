13. Copying and pasting: y, Y
---------------

Now we can learn a very useful command that we use every day - copying and pasting.
In vimland, "copying" is refered to as "yanking."

We can use the "y" key, along with several variations of it to yank text:
y - yank (or copy)
    yy current line
    5yy this line, and 4 more under it
    yw to the end of this word
    y$ to the end of the line
    y^ to the first non-white space
    ygg to the beginning of the file
    yG to the end of file
    y20G yanks to the 20th line of the file
Y - yank entire line

Remember that p or P is used to paste!

These are just a fraction of the various ways to yank text.
