12. Cutting and pasting: d, p, P
---------------

Deleting doesn't just delete keys, it copies it into the buffer (or the clipboard).
Sound familiar? This is exactly how "cut" works. 

To "paste" this snippet, use the following:
p - paste below cursor line
P - paste above cursor line

dd - deletes (or cuts) current line

Let's delete this line...
and make it reappear below!

Can you make "superfragilisticexpialidocious" disappear?
Now paste it here! ->

Wow! What is this sorcery? Are you a wizard? Can you make this rabbit disappear too?

Don't forget to make it re-appear!
Or the kids will be very upset...

Great job! In the next tutorial we'll look at copying and pasting.

2) "5u"
