08. Inserting, opening and joining lines: o, O, J
---------------

Let's say you want to append some code beneath a line. 

To do this, we had to go to our line, then press "A" and ENTER.

Thankfully, vim makes this process much easier with the "o" key. 
Think of "o" as in open.

To add a line, use:
o - open a line below
O - open a line above 

Let's add some comments to this python function:

def sumAndSquare(a, b):
#comment here
  sum = a+b
	# another comment here
  return sum ** 2

We can also join lines together.
J - join current line with the one below

Turn this block of text into one line!

Review Questions:
1) Insert a period at the end of this line
2) Insert a "please" in front of the following sentences:
  give me a cookie.
  don't text and drive.
 



Solutions:
1) A.
2) on each line, type "IPlease"
