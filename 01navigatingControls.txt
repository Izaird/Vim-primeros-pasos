01. Navigating controls: h, j, k, l, ESC, [0-9]
---------------

Hello!

Vim is a "modal editor," meaning it has different modes. 

Vim opens in COMMAND mode. 
If you ever find Vim in a different mode (or if it's acting wonky), 
simply press ESC to re-activate COMMAND mode. 

Great! We'll start with basic navigation. 

To move around in Vim:
l - move right
h - move left
j - move down
k - move up

Time to practice!
go right (l) go left (h)
move down (j)
let's move back up (k)

Stray away from the [[arrow keys]]!

  Yay, we are learning
how to navigate with Vim
  This is so much fun!

We can make this more efficient using a numerical modifier.
Simply precede the command with an value [0-9].
For example, 4h moves 4 characters to the left.

Quit by typing ":q!"

The ":" activates ex commands, which we will cover in more advanced tutorials.
The "q" means to quit.
The "!" means to quit without any unsaved changes.
