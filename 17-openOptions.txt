17. Open Options: 
---------------
Normally, we would start Vim with the following command:
$ vim fileName

To open a file at line 12:
$ vim +12 fileName

To open a file at the last line:
$ vim + fileName

To open a file at the first occurance of a pattern:
$ vim +/pattern fileName

This can be helpful, as you can mark a spot in your document and jump right into it. 
Oftentimes you can write a unique text as your marked pattern.

QQQ If you left off at this sentence, you can quickly reopen this file, and start where you left off.

Additionally, we may enter in READ-ONLY mode:
$ vim -R sampleFile
Or we can simply type:
$ view file

We will be able to write into this file, but we won't get too far when trying to save it.
To override READ-ONLY mode, type ":w!"
