04. Navigating sentences and paragraphs: {, } (braces), (, ) (parantheses)
---------------

Now we can navigate through long paragraphs,
or big blocks of code!

Use these keys to wade through sentences in a paragraph:
( - start of sentence
) - end of sentence

This is a sample sentence. This is another sample sentence. Does a question mark complete the a sentence? How about an exclamation point? Yes! Yes they all do! Isn't this so exciting? Yes. Yes it is. 

To find the end of a sentence, Vim looks for "?", ".", or "!".

Use these keys to navigate through paragraphs:
{ - start of paragraph
} - end of paragraph 

Vim considers a paragraph as a block of text surrounded with blank lines.
Like this, for example.
Ch-ch-check it out!

   */
  public void setSpeed(int newSpeed) {
    speed = newSpeed;

  /** apply brakes 
   */ 
  public void applyBrake(int decrement) {
    speed -= decrement;

   */
  public void speedUp(int increment) {
    speed += increment;     
  }

Review Questions: 
1) How would you navigate through lines of code, where there are indentations? 
2) What's the difference between using "0" and "^"?




Solutions:
1) You can use "-" and "+" or "-" and "[return]". Using the [return] is more efficient since you don't have to hold the [shift] key.
2) "0" is to the beginning of the line, while "^" is to the first non-white space of a line.
